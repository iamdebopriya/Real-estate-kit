##  Project Features and Implementation Summary

### 1. **Basic Form Fields Implementation**  
**Purpose:**  
Developed a comprehensive form that captures essential personal, identification, and property-related information. This includes fields such as:  
- Personal Info: Name, Mobile Number, Email, Date of Birth, Marital Status, Occupation, Annual Income  
- Identity Proofs: Aadhaar Number, PAN Number  
- Address Details: Address, City, State, Pincode  
- Property Preferences: Category, Type (BHK), Size (sqft), Facing Direction, Floor Number

### 2. **State Management with `useState` for Form Data**  
**Purpose:**  
Utilized React’s `useState` hook to maintain a centralized `formData` object. This enables:  
- Real-time state updates for each input  
- Seamless two-way data binding  
- Cleaner state management within a single component  

---

### 3. **Form Validation Logic**  
**Purpose:**  
Created a `validateForm` function to ensure user inputs are accurate and in the correct format. The logic includes:  
- Required field checks (e.g., name, email)  
- Format validation (e.g., proper email structure)  
- Regex-based checks (e.g., Aadhaar = 12 digits, PAN format)  
- Input sanitization (trimming whitespaces before validation)  
This ensures a higher quality of data submission and better backend integration.

### 4. **Error Handling with Dedicated `errors` State**  
**Purpose:**  
Used a separate `errors` object in state to track field-specific validation failures. This allows:  
- Clean separation between valid and invalid input states  
- Dynamic display of error messages adjacent to form fields  
- Better form accessibility and user experience  

---

### 5. **Dynamic Fields Management via `extraFields` Object**  
**Purpose:**  
Introduced a modular `extraFields` object inside `formData` to handle optional and dynamic fields such as:  
- Car Parking Preference  
- Payment Plan (Installment/Down Payment)  
- Mode of Payment (Cheque, Draft, Pay Order)  
- Loan Requirements  
- Custom Sources of Information  
This structure makes the form state extensible and cleanly organized.

---

### 6. **Advanced Input Types and Dynamic Rendering**  
**Purpose:**  
Implemented a variety of input types to enhance form flexibility:  
- `<select>` for dropdowns  
- `<radio>` for exclusive options  
- `<checkbox>` for multiple selections  
Dynamically rendered input options via mapping arrays, while maintaining consistent state updates using structured field names like `extraFields.carParking`.

---

### 7. **Conditional and Custom Input Support**  
**Purpose:**  
Enabled support for custom, user-defined inputs to collect non-standard data:  
- “Preferred Financier” (text input)  
- “Other Sources of Information” (fallback input field)  
These fields are fully integrated with the main state (`formData.extraFields`) to ensure complete data handling.

---

### 8. **Real-Time Live Preview Component**  
**Purpose:**  
Built a styled live preview section that shows user-submitted form data in real time. Benefits include:  
- Instant feedback for the user  
- Opportunity to review before submission  
- Enhanced user experience through clean presentation  
Styled using TailwindCSS with soft shadows, blur effects, and modern typography.

---

### 9. **Dynamic Estimated Price Calculation**  
**Purpose:**  
Implemented a utility function to estimate property pricing based on user selections. The formula dynamically incorporates:  
- Property size  
- Type and category  
- Bonus factors (e.g., facing, floor, add-ons)  
This feature provides transparency and helps users make informed decisions.

---

### 10. **TailwindCSS-Based Responsive UI Design**  
**Purpose:**  
Leveraged TailwindCSS to design a mobile-friendly, visually appealing, and responsive user interface with:  
- Grid layouts and spacing control  
- Styled form controls and cards  
- Glassmorphism and utility-first design approach  
Ensures consistent look and feel across browsers and devices with minimal custom CSS.
